# Car-Tracking
Project for course ECE 272B - Filtering and Estimation

## Given

* Two radar with positions (0, 0) and (0, -1000) are given. We are given 61 radar measurements. The interval between the radar measurements is 5 seconds. The range error of the radar is 95m and bearing error is 30 milliradian.
* We are also provided with speed ($(v_x, v_y)$). We are provided the map of the path which the object to be tracked takes.
* The start point of the object is (-500, -400).
